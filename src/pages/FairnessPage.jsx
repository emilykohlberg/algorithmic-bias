          I will discuss algorithmic bias and fairness through an explainer
          blog/website. This will be aimed towards high school or college
          students early on in their computer science education or students who
          do not plan on studying computer science. This is an important and
          often overlooked computer science topic that I have only recently seen
          in classes, but I think it would be better to learn about earlier as
          fighting algorithmic bias should shape the way that people program.
          Societal biases are often reflected in artificial intelligence
          algorithms, whether this is intentional or unintentional. Algorithmic
          bias is something that can be fixed, which can lead to a more fair
          future for marginalized communities, but people need to be educated on
          the topic in order to do this. The intent behind the design will be to
          make people aware of the issue, provide tangible examples so they can
          understand how it affects people, and offer solutions that they can
          use in their own programming. Because the target audience is not very
          familiar with computer science, it will stay at a fairly high level
          instead of going into the mechanics of different fairness
          metrics/algorithms. For computer science students, it is meant to
          spark interest in the topic early on in their education because I
          think it will help shape their overall outlook on programming rather
          than feel like an afterthought if it were to be presented later on in
          their careers. For non-computer science students, it is meant to teach
          them about the social implications that algorithmic bias has on the
          world.
