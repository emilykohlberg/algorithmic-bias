        <p>
          My name is Emily Kohlberg, and I am a junior at Northwestern
          University majoring in Computer Science.

          I created this project because I felt like algorithmic bias was not
          introduced early enough in my Computer Science education, so I wanted
          to provide a resource that high school students and early college
          students could use to learn more about algorithmic bias. I hope that
          my website is able to spark interest and help students make more
          informed design decisions as they begin their journey in Computer
          Science.
